- CAS is a requirement for all IB1 and IB2 diploma students; if you fail to fulfill CAS requirements, the diploma will not be awarded.
- You must have an adult supervisor (not a relative or friend) for every every activity/project.
- Activities must be carried out regularly over IB1 year and during the first two terms of IB2 year. The minimum time allocated should be the equivalent of one afternoon (3 hours) a week.
- Self-review at the beginning of your CAS experience and set personal goals for what you hope to achieve through your CAS programme
- Plan, do and reflect (plan activities, carry them out and reflect on what you have learned)
- Undertake at least one interim review and a final review with your  CAS advisor
- Take part in a range of activities and achievements, including a list of the Principle activities undertaken
- show evidence of achievement of the eight CAS learning outcomes


#### Responsibilities

You must inform the CAS coordinator <a href="mailto:marja-liisa.lepik@tik.edu.ee">(marja-liisa.lepik@tik.edu.ee)</a> well in advance about any changes or new activity that you want to include in CAS. The change/new activity has to be approved by the coordinator before you start it. If you fail to do this, the activity is not counted as CAS!

When you start a new activity, your supervisor must be informed about CAS and what is expected of him (Form 7). Before the activity is completed you should ask the supervisors to fill in Form 6. This form must be given to the supervisor well in advance. It is your responsibility to ensure that this report is completed and given to the CAS coordinator.

#### Guidelines for your CAS diary

- A record must be kept for each CAS activity undertaken
- Keep your diary up to date. Write your entries immediately after the activity takes place.
- Give a short description of every activity event together with some personal reflective remarks and comments.
- If you have any extra material (photos, newspaper articles, letters, pictures, etc.) concerning your CAS activities you are encouraged to attach them to your diary.
