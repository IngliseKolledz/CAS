title: CAS Elements
---

CAS involves three equally important elements.

#### Creativity — arts, performance, design. The goals are:

- to develop creative thinking
- to explore new skills and talents
- to take previous skills further by setting new goals and applying them in broader and more significant contexts
- to develop an appreciation of other ways of expression and of other cultures
- to develop curiosity, an enquiring approach to life, and critical thinking skills

#### Action — physical work, training and skills, expeditions. Encourages a healthy lifestyle through:

- engaging in physical exertion
- taking part in expeditions
- developing existing skills further
- participating rather than being spectators
- challenging existing limits of performance and endurance
 
#### Service — all forms of help for people who need it. Benefits & goals:

- You are needed: come and feel it!
- Gain in confidence, self-esteem, personal recognition and identity development are achieved through emotional learning.
- interpersonal, intergenerational, intercultural relationships.
- you'll have face-to-face relationships with people from different backgrounds, needs and abilities.
- The intercultural element is an essential part of the service programme: respect and understanding are only learned from interaction.
- Personal challenges and cultural risk-taking is only possible when interacting with people from an unfamiliar cultural and social environment.
- “The manner of giving is worth more than the gift” — attitude matters.

Service is a mutually beneficial exchange relationship established by the student with a person or a group of people expressing a real need which the student can contribute to answer by performing a real task that will have real consequences on the wellbeing of all the parties involved. The need must be expressed by the person that feels it, not just identified by the student.



CAS is about quality, not quantity; attitude is what matters. CAS is about real commitment, being involved with others and contributing your time and talents. CAS activities should continue on a regular basis.
