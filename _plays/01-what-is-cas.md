title: What is CAS
---

CAS is a fundamental element of the IB diploma programme. It will involve

1. real purposeful activities, with significant outcomes
2. a personal challenge
3. thoughtful consideration, such as planning, reviewing and reporting progress
4. reflection on outcomes and personal learning


CAS activities should continue on regular basis for as long as possible throughout the programme, and certainly for at least 18 months. It should provide provide a challenge and result in progress, development and personal growth, but still be achievable in scope

Your progress is evaluated by you yourself, your supervisors and coordinator.
